    <h1>Chicago Crime Setting Reports By Police District</h1>
    <h2>Mia Cohen, Saurav Patel</h2>
    
    <div class="container">
        <p>Welcome to our page. For this interactive visualization, we used crime report data from <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/stories/s/Crimes-2001-to-present-Dashboard/5cd6-ry5g">Chicago Police Department's report statistics</a>
            for citizen-reported crimes. There were many calls, so we looked specifically at the year 2024 for this map. We counted both the number of crimes and the settings described in the reporting of the crimes. You can use the dropdown menu to select a specific setting
            and see the data on hovering above the district. A darker red means a higher proportion of the TOTAL crimes that were listed with this setting have been reported in this district. A police district (our divisions) designates what a precinct is responsible for.

            <br>
            We chose red for our heatmap shade becuase it's a good color to indicate intensity, and the blue for mouseover to 
            distinguish it from the red districts We considered a dot-plot with or segmented bar graphs, but ultimately landed on 
            a map for maximum intuitiveness, building off of the map examples on CPD website.

        <p>The process of developing this was a joint effort, with about 10 man-hours in 
            total work. Both members of the team participated in data selection, collection, and trimming as well as programming the interactive elements of the site. Mia individually handled site structre, initialization, and writing while 
            Saurav individually handled the heatmap. Getting the heatmap live and ensuring webpage responsiveness were the most time-consuming tasks.
